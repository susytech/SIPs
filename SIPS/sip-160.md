### Hard fork
[Spurious Dragon](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/blob/master/SIPS/sip-607.md)

### Parameters
- `FORK_BLKNUM`: 2,675,000
- `CHAIN_ID`: 1

### Specification

If `block.number >= FORK_BLKNUM`, increase the gas cost of EXP from 10 + 10 per byte in the exponent to 10 + 50 per byte in the exponent.

### Rationale

Benchmarks suggest that EXP is currently underpriced by a factor of about 4â€“8.
