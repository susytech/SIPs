type: Meta
status: Draft

## Abstract

To describe the formal process of preparing and activating hard forks.

## Motivation

Today discussions about hard forks happen at various forums and sometimes in ad-hoc ways.

## Specification

A Meta SIP should be created and merged as a *Draft* as soon as a new hard fork is planned.

This SIP should contain:
- the desired codename of the hard fork,
- activation block number once decided
- a timeline section
- an SIPs to include section
- the **Requires** header should point to the previous hard fork meta SIP.

The draft shall be updated with summaries of the decisions around the hard fork.

### Timeline

Once a timeline with key dates is agreed upon for other crucial dates. The basic outline of a hardfork timeline should include:
* Hard deadline to accept proposals for this hard fork
* Soft deadline for major client implementations
* Projected date for testnet network upgrade
* Projected date for mainnet upgrade (the activation block number / projected date for this block)

### SIP Inclusion Process

Anyone that wishes to propose a Core SIP for the hard fork should make a PR against the Meta SIP representing the hard fork. The SIP must be published as at least `Draft`. It enters the _Proposed SIPs_ section, along with at least one person who is a point of contact for wanting to include the SIP.

Once the SIP has been accepted by Core Devs, the SIP should be moved to the _Accepted SIPs_ section. If the SIP has major client implementations and no security issues by the timeline date, it is scheduled for inclusion.

---

The Meta SIP representing the hard fork should move in to the `Accepted` state once the changes are frozen (i.e. all referenced SIPs are in the `Accepted` state) and in to the `Final` state once the hard fork has been activated.

## Template

A template for the [Istanbul Hardfork Meta 1679](https://sips.superstring.ch/SIPS/sip-1679) is included below ([source file on Github](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/blob/master/SIPS/sip-1679.md)):
