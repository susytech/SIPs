## Simple Summary
A standard interface for a simple proxy account.

## Abstract

The following describes standard functions for a unique identifiable proxy account to be used by humans, groups, organisations, objects and machines. The proxy has 2 abilities: (1) it can execute arbitrary contract calls, and (2) it can hold arbitrary data through a generic key/value store. One of these keys should hold the owner of the contract. The owner may be an address or a key manager contract for more complex management logic. Most importantly, this contract should be the reference point for a long-lasting identifiable profiles.

## Motivation

Standardizing a minimal interface for an proxy account allows third parties to interact with various proxy accounts contracts in a consistent manner. 
the benefit is a persistent account that is independed from single keys and can attach an arbitrary amount of information to verifiy, or enhance the accounts purpose.

## Specification


### Methods

#### owner

Returns the current owner

```js
address public owner;
```

#### changeOwner

Changes the current owner. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

```js
function changeOwner(address _owner);
```

**Triggers Event:** [OwnerChanged](#ownsrchanged)

#### getData

Returns the data at the specified key.

```js
function getData(bytes32 _key) external view returns (bytes _value);
```

#### setData

Sets the data at a specific key. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

**Triggers Event:** [DataChanged](#datachanged)

```js
function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes _value) external;
```

#### execute

Executes an action on other contracts or a transfer of the blockchains native cryptocurrency. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

```js
function execute(uint256 _operationType, address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external;
```

The `operationType` should represent the assembly operation as follows:
- `0` for `call`
- `1` for `create`

Others may be added in the future. Inspired by [SRC1077](https://sips.superstring.ch/SIPS/sip-1077) and [Gnosis](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Enum.sol#L7)

### Events


#### DataChanged

MUST be triggered when `setData` was successfully called.

```js
event DataChanged(bytes32 indexed key, bytes value);
```

#### ContractCreated

MUST be triggered when `execute` creates a new contract using the `_operationType` `1`.

```js
event ContractCreated(address indexed contractAddress);
```

#### OwnerChanged

MUST be triggered when `changeOwner` was successfully called.

```js
event OwnerChanged(address indexed ownerAddress);
```


### Ownership

This contract is controlled by the owner. The owner can be a smart contract or an address, or itself.

### Data keys

Data keys, should be the keccak256 hash of a type name.
e.g. `myNewKeyType` is `0xa94996022594f93c34a730df0ae89d1ecd69dff98c17d0387e69ce58346323a4`

#### Multiple keys of the same type

Multiple keys for the same key type must add a `keyTypeName-1` at the end of the key type.

This would looks as follows for `myNewKeyType`:  
version 0 `myNewKeyType`: `0xa94996022594f93c34a730df0ae89d1ecd69dff98c17d0387e69ce58346323a4`   
version 1 `myNewKeyType-1`: `0xb6dace1ed14874742c4d1b8cd9b270305176f769e0ae22118a02c2db4e620f29`   
version 2 `myNewKeyType-2`: `0x6cc96a01de588f4550e8c3a821aed065ae7897f8dfb61836c78c0389e499d9ed`   
...

Anyone that would like to standardize a new data key should make a pull request to update the table below.

| Name | Description | Key | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| owner | The owner of the proxy account | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | left padded owner address, e.g. `0x000000000000000000000000de0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe` |
| 735 | The proxy accounts claim holder contract (per [SRC735](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/issues/735)) | 0xb0f23aea7d77ce19f9393243a7b50a3bcaac893c7d68a5a309dea7cacf035fd0 | left padded address of the claim holder contract,  e.g. `0x000000000000000000000000de0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe` |
| 780 | The proxy accounts claim holder contract (per [SRC735](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/issues/735)) | 0xdaf52dba5981246bcf8fd7c6b00dce587fdcf5e2a95b281eea95dcd1376afdcd | left padded address of the claim registry contract,  e.g. `0x000000000000000000000000de0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe` |

## Rationale

The purpose of an identity proxy is to allow an entity to exist as a first-class citizen in Susy, with the ability to execute arbitrary contract calls. At that same time the proxy account should be managed by an arbitrary simple or complex logic.

It also opens up the possibility of [meta transactions](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/susy-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84), where a third party can send a transaction to the owner contract, that then verifies the execution permission based on a signed message.

It further allows any information to be attached to that proxy accounts which can be in the forms of claims via [SRC735](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/issues/735) or [SRC780](https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/issues/780), or any arbitrary new systems and protocols.

This specification was chosen to allow the most flexibility and experimentation around verifiable manageable accounts.


## Implementation

- [Implementation by SRC725Alliance](https://github.com/SRC725Alliance/src725/tree/master/contracts/contracts)


### Solidity Interface
```js
pragma solidity ^0.5.4;

interface SRC725 {
    event DataChanged(bytes32 indexed key, bytes32 indexed value);
    event OwnerChanged(address indexed ownerAddress);
    event ContractCreated(address indexed contractAddress);

    // address public owner;

    function changeOwner(address _owner) external;
    function getData(bytes32 _key) external view returns (bytes32 _value);
    function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes32 _value) external;
    function execute(uint256 _operationType, address _to, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```
