<p>Susy Improvement Proposals (SIPs) describe standards for the Susy platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="SIPS/sip-1">SIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your SIP to it. There is a <a href="https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/blob/master/sip-X.md">template SIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to Susy's <a href="https://github.com/susytech/SIPs">SIPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2>SIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - an SIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - an SIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepted</strong> - a core SIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an SIP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the SIP process. If such a decision is made, the SIP wil move to final. </li>
  <li><strong>Final (non-Core)</strong> - an SIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.</li>
  <li><strong>Final (Core)</strong> - an SIP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred</strong> an SIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SIP Types</h2>

<p>SIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of SIPs.</p>

<h3>Standard Track ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects most or all Susy implementations, such as a change to the the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Susy. Furthermore Standard SIPs can be broken down into the following categories.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"core"|relative_url}}">Core</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Core"|size}})</h4>
<p>Improvements requiring a consensus fork (e.g. <a href="SIPS/sip-5">SIP5</a>, <a href="SIPS/sip-101">SIP101</a>), as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions (for example, the miner/node strategy changes 2, 3, and 4 of <a href="SIPS/sip-86">SIP86</a>).</p>

<h4><a href="{{"networking"|relative_url}}">Networking</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Networking"|size}})</h4>
<p>Includes improvements around devp2p (<a href="SIPS/sip-8">SIP8</a>) and Light Susy Subprotocol, as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"interface"|relative_url}}">Interface</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Interface"|size}})</h4>
<p>Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names (<a href="SIPS/sip-6">SIP6</a>) and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an SIP is submitted to the SIPs repository.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"src"|relative_url}}">SRC</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","SRC"|size}})</h4>
<p>Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards (<a href="SIPS/sip-20">SRC20</a>), name registries (<a href="SIPS/sip-137">SRC137</a>), URI schemes (<a href="SIPS/sip-681">SRC681</a>), library/package formats (<a href="SIPS/sip-190">SIP190</a>), and wallet formats (<a href="https://github.com/susytech/SIPs/issues/85">SIP85</a>).</p>

<h3><a href="{{"informational"|relative_url}}">Informational</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Informational"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes a Susy design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Susy community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SIPs do not necessarily represent Susy community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational SIPs or follow their advice.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"meta"|relative_url}}">Meta</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Meta"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes a process surrounding Susy or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SIPs are like Standards Track SIPs but apply to areas other than the Susy protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Susy's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational SIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Susy development. Any meta-SIP is also considered a Process SIP.</p>
